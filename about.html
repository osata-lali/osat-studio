                    <h3>The Journey Begins in Gash-Barka</h3>
                    <p>My name is osat, and my journey into photography began not in a studio, but under the vast, hot sun of the Gash-Barka region of Eritrea. Witnessing the vibrant life and enduring customs of the Kunama people—known for their deep connection to the land and their unique **Marda** (artistic) expressions—I realized the urgency of preservation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Africa Lenses</strong> was founded with a singular purpose: to ethically document and celebrate the cultural narrative of communities often overlooked. We specialize in long-term documentary projects that capture not just the moment, but the historical context and the spiritual weight of Kunama traditions, like the annual harvest rituals and traditional wedding ceremonies.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our commitment goes beyond aesthetics; it is a promise to share a truthful, respectful, and visually stunning record of this irreplaceable heritage with the world.</p>
